# min-finder
This little project had the objective to find the pulses in a signal. It finds the minima that are below a certain threshold, being very fast on that. It is based on SciPy's peak-finding function, but it finds minima instead of maxima and only applies the pulse-finding algorithm in parts of the waveform that are smaller than a threshold.
